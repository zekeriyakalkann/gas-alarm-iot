# IoT Gas Leak & Smoke Alarm System

An embedded and IoT-based safety system designed to detect gas leaks and smoke
and notify users in real time.

## 🔧 Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- MQ-5 Gas Sensor
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Buzzer
- LEDs
- LCD Display (planned)
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (planned)

## 🧠 System Overview
The system continuously monitors gas levels and triggers visual, audible,
and cloud-based alerts when dangerous thresholds are exceeded.

## 📡 IoT Features
- Wi-Fi communication via ESP8266
- Real-time notifications (IFTTT)

## 🗂️ Project Structure
- `arduino/` -> Arduino firmware
